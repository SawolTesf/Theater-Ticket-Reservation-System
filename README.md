# Theater Ticket Reservation System

Welcome to the Theater Ticket Reservation System! This project showcases a Java program that simulates an online ticket reservation system for a small theater. The program allows attendees to select seats, displays the current seating arrangement, and generates a report indicating how many seats were sold/unsold and how much money was earned.

## Project Description

The Theater Ticket Reservation System is a backend application that handles customer demand for a small theater in Montana. The seating arrangement for each auditorium is stored in a file and represented in a two-dimensional array. The program offers a user-friendly menu system for seat reservation and provides an option to reserve the best available seats if the desired seats are not available.

Please note: This project is purely for demonstration purposes and does not process actual payments or reservations.

## Key Features

- **Seating Arrangement**: Displays the current seating availability for each auditorium.
- **Seat Reservation**: Allows users to reserve sequential seats based on their preference.
- **Best Available Seats**: Offers the best available seats that meet user criteria on the selected row.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a report indicating how many seats were sold/unsold and how much money was earned.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Java Programming**: Utilizes Java programming fundamentals such as file I/O, loops, conditional statements, arrays, and functions.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that user data falls within the proper range and prevents users from reserving already reserved seats.
- **User Interface Design**: Presents a user-friendly menu system for seat reservation.

## Technical Details

The Theater Ticket Reservation System is developed using Java. It employs file I/O to read and write the seating arrangement from and to a file. The program validates user inputs and handles seat reservations based on user preferences.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance the app with the following features:

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts for personalized experiences.
- **Multiple Auditoriums**: Extend the system to handle multiple auditoriums.
- **Advanced Seat Selection**: Provide an option for users to select non-sequential seats or seats from different rows.

## Contact

I am excited about this project and eager to improve it further. Your feedback, contributions, and suggestions are highly appreciated. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate. Thank you for visiting the Theater Ticket Reservation System!
